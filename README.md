# Smart Cane Research Paper
The main idea in this paper is to incresses the obstacle detection of the existing smartcane.
We achived this by introducing gyroscopic sensor and an alogorithm to calculte the distance and height of the obstacle using
the angle of inclination of the stick and the distance measured by the gyroscopic sensor.
